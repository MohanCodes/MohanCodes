# Hi, I'm Mohan 👋

I am a high school and PSEO student at the University of Minnesota interested in computational biology and bioengineering. While taking university courses in algorithms, probability, and stem‑cell biology, I work in the Staley Lab on microbiome data from canine lymphoma and sarcoma patients. I also do freelance web development for nonprofits and student organizations, building tools that automate workflows and surface data people actually need.

- 🔭 Building now: reproducible R/Python pipelines for cancer‑associated metagenomics, a fluorescence‑simulation web app for a YC‑backed biotech startup, and MNClubConnect, which is a club indexing platform serving 3,500+ students.

- 🌱 Leveling up: rigorous statistics for high‑dimensional biology, cleaner software architecture, and sharper problem framing—turning "interesting" into "testable."

- 🤝 Open to: research collaborations that need dependable compute and analysis, early‑stage teams shipping biomedical or data‑infrastructure products, and mentoring students breaking into CS or comp bio.

- 💬 Ask me about: metagenomics workflows, making one‑off scripts into reproducible pipelines, helping nonprofits focus on what matters, FIRST Robotics control/vision, or how to go from zero to your first bioinformatics project.

- 🧰 For learners: happy to share starter templates, code reviews, and "here's how I'd structure this" guidance-especially for R/Python data projects.
