# Mohan Atkuri

PSEO @ UMN • Staley Lab • code + biology + tools

I like problems where there’s messy real‑world data (labs, nonprofits, robots) and the job is to make it structured, usable, and automated.

---

## What I actually do

- **Microbiome research** – build R/Python workflows for shotgun + 16S data in the Staley/Jahansouz Lab.  
- **Biotech modeling** – prototyped and shipped a fluorescence‑simulation web tool for a YC‑backed startup.  
- **Robotics** – wrote control + vision code for an FRC robot (four‑motor arm, game‑piece tracking).  
- **Nonprofit infra** – built FYRS, a Python + MongoDB system that auto‑generates and emails donor tax receipts.

## Some projects

- **MNClubConnect** – Next.js/TypeScript + Firebase platform for discovering student clubs.  
- **Urban Fox** – React Native app that makes running into a multiplayer game.  
- **FYRS** – desktop app that churns out IRS‑compliant yearly donation statements for a 501(c)(3).

## Currently

- Classes: algorithms, probability, stem cells, medical ethics, startup customer development.  
- Interests: comp bio, swarm/robotics, and building tools that sit between research and production.
