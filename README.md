# Hi, I’m Mohan 👋

I like building things at the intersection of code, biology, and real‑world systems.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on  
  microbiome data analysis in the Staley Lab and a few web/tools projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning  
  algorithms, probability, and stem‑cell biology, plus getting deeper into comp bio + robotics/swarms.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
  small tools for researchers, robotics teams, or nonprofits where software actually changes someone’s day.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with  
  breaking into more multi‑agent / robotics work and figuring out how to point my CS + bio mix in the right direction.

- 💬 Ask me about  
  automating boring workflows, student club tooling, FIRST robotics code, or getting started with microbiome analysis.

- ⚡ Fun fact  
  I’ve written software for everything from dog‑poop microbiome data to temple donation receipts to robots chasing game pieces.
